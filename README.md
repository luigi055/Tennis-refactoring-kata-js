# Tennis Refactoring Kata Javascript.

## tennis1 file 
  this file was refactored using OOP JavaScript style
## tennis2 file
  this file was refactored using functional programming JavaScript style
## tennis3 file 
  this file was refactored with simple javascript function style with primitives.
  for me this is the way I would refactored the code in real life for simplicity purpose and since this application domain is really small.
